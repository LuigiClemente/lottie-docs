Implementing Lottie animations with an SVG renderer, allowing you to style them with CSS to some extent, involves a few key steps. Here's a basic tutorial on how to get started:

### Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* A Lottie animation file (in JSON format).

### Step 1: Include the Lottie Player Library

First, you need to include the Lottie player in your project. You can do this by adding a script tag in your HTML file.

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lottie-web/5.7.4/lottie.min.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Add a Container for the Lottie Animation

Create a container in your HTML where the Lottie animation will be displayed.

```html
<div id="lottie-container"></div>
```

### Step 3: Initialize Lottie with SVG Renderer

In your JavaScript file or script tag, initialize the Lottie animation and specify the SVG renderer.

```javascript
lottie.loadAnimation({
  container: document.getElementById('lottie-container'), // the DOM element
  renderer: 'svg', // specifying SVG rendering
  loop: true,
  autoplay: true,
  path: 'path_to_your_animation.json' // path to your Lottie file
});
```

### Step 4: Apply CSS Styles

Now, you can apply CSS styles to the container. Remember, these styles will apply to the container and not directly to the SVG elements of the animation. For example:

```css
#lottie-container {
  width: 400px;
  height: 400px;
  margin: auto;
  background-color: lightgrey;
}
```

### Limitations and Considerations

* Direct manipulation of SVG elements inside Lottie is limited. You can't, for example, easily change the color of specific elements as you might with a standard SVG.
* The CSS you apply is to the container element. Effects like `transform`, `opacity`, or `filter` will apply to the entire animation.
* Complex manipulations require JavaScript and a good understanding of the Lottie file's structure.

### Step 5: Experiment and Debug

* You might need to experiment with different styles and see how they affect the animation.
* Use browser developer tools to inspect the SVG elements created by Lottie and understand how your styles are being applied.

### Additional Tips

* If you need to change specific elements within the Lottie animation, consider editing the animation source file (e.g., in Adobe After Effects) before exporting it as a Lottie JSON.
* Always test the animation across different browsers to ensure compatibility and performance.

This tutorial gives you a starting point for using Lottie with SVG rendering and applying CSS styles to it. Depending on your specific use case, you might need to dive deeper into Lottie's documentation and experiment with its various capabilities.
